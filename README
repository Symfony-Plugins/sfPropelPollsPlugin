== Installation ==

To install the plugin, run this command within your symfony project :

{{{
symfony plugin-install http://plugins.symfony-project.com/sfPropelPollsPlugin
}}}

Copy the sample configuration file from 
{{{myproject/plugins/sfPropelPollsPlugin/config/sfPropelPollsPlugin.yml.sample}}} 
into yout project's (not application!) {{{config/}}} folder. Rename it to 
{{{myproject/config/sfPropelPollsPlugin.yml}}}. If you want to specify the name 
of the existing user table and class, edit this file (see [#PluginConfiguration 
next section about the plugin configuration] for further details).

If you use symfony 1.0, you must manually register a config handler for this 
configuration file by creating a {{{config_handlers.yml}}} file in your 
application {{{config/}}} directory with the following content:

{{{
config/sfPropelPollsPlugin.yml:
  class:    sfPropelPollsConfigHandler
  param:
    prefix: sf_propel_polls_
}}}

 Of course, il you already have a {{{config_handlers.yml}}} file in your 
 {{{config/}}} directory, you have to append the previously mentionned content to 
 the existing one.

This last step '''is not required if you use symfony 1.1'''.

Then, rebuild your model :

{{{
symfony propel-build-all
}}}

Now, as a pure Symfony tradition, purge your cache :

{{{
symfony cc
}}}

=== Plugin configuration ===

==== The {{{sfPropelPollsPlugin.yml}}} file ====

The plugin schema is configurable to match your database table names. Here is 
the default plugin configuration, taken from 
{{{myproject/plugins/sfSimpleBlogPlugin/config/sfPropelPollsPlugin.yml.sample}}}:

{{{
schema:
  connection:                propel                 # database connection you want to use (related to the databases.yml configuration)
  user_table:                sf_guard_user          # user table name
  user_id:                   id                     # primary key of the user table
  user_class:                sfGuardUser            # name of the Propel object for users
  polls_table:               sf_polls               # polls table name
  polls_answers_table:       sf_polls_answers       # polls answers table name
  polls_users_answers_table: sf_polls_users_answers # polls votes table name
}}}

You can customize these settings in {{{myproject/config/sfPropelPollsPlugin.yml}}}.

'''Note:''' After modifying the schema settings, you must rebuild your model. 

=== The {{{app.yml}}} file ===

=== SVN repository ===

The plugin is also available through the Symfony SVN repository.

Stable version are available in the 
{{{[http://svn.symfony-project.com/plugins/sfPropelPollsPlugin/tags tags]}}} 
folder, experimental ones in the 
{{{[http://svn.symfony-project.com/plugins/sfPropelPollsPlugin/branches branches]}}} 
one and the current alpha in the {{{[http://svn.symfony-project.com/plugins/sfPropelPollsPlugin/trunk trunk]}}}.

'''Caution:''' Never use the trunk version in a production environment.

== Usage ==

=== API ===

The API is mainly available from the {{{./lib/model/sfPoll.php}}} class object, 
phpdoc is quite exhaustive.

=== Modules ===

The plugin provide both Back and Front office standard modules that you can 
activate in the {{{settings.yml}}} of your apps.

In front office, you can activate the sfPolls module :

{{{
  .settings
    enabled_modules: [default, ..., sfPolls]
}}}

In back office, you should activate the sfPollsAdmin module :

{{{
  .settings
    enabled_modules: [default, ..., sfPollsAdmin]
}}}

Front office routes url are provided by default, here they are:

 * {{{polls}}}: lists all published polls
 * {{{poll_detail?id=id}}}: shows poll form
 * {{{poll_results?id=id}}}: shows poll results
 * {{{poll_vote}}}: handle voting request
 
If you wish to deactivate these routes, you can set this setting in the 
{{{app.yml}}} of your app:

{{{
all:
  sfPropelPollsPlugin:
    routes_register:    false
}}}

Note that you'll have to specify corresponding routes in your {{{routing.yml}}} 
file for the plugin to work.

=== Components ===

The plugin also provide standard component to ease polls integration. To display 
a polling form as a Symfony component, be sure to have activated the sfPolls 
module in your settings.yml as described previously and put something like this 
in a template :

{{{
<h2>Poll</h2>
<?php include_component('sfPolls', 'poll_form', array('poll_id' => 1)) ?>
}}}

This will display the polling form of the sfPoll object with PK=1.
